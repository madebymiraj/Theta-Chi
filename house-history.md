## Former Chapter Housing

December 17, 1962 to January 1972, President John Zozzaro signed a lease for the house located at 17 Warren Street, in downtown Newark.

January 1972 to 1984, through the extensive efforts of Alumnus Phillip Rinaldi and undergraduate Fred Cohen, the chapter purchased a house located at 103 Bleeker Street. In the spring of 1980, Ken Mosey completed his famous mural on the side of the chapter house. The mural would later make it on the cover of the Rattle of Theta Chi, the fraternity’s national magazine.

1984 to December 1989, following the demolition of the house located at 103 Bleeker Street, the chapter found temporary housing at 295 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, the old Kappa Xi Kappa house.

## The Firehouse

December 1989 to Present: The former Engine 4 Ladder 2 Newark Firehouse located at 241-243 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was purchased on December 1986 by the Fraternity for $72,001 thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Alumni President, Tom Usewicz during a public bidding organized by the city. Because the building had been unoccupied for many years, the brotherhood had to wait for repairs to get done before they could move in. One of the first things to get done was the removal of the fire poles in the house due to insurance reasons. Furthermore, once the house was ready, twelve brothers moved in during the winter break of 1989.

As new residents of the firehouse, the brotherhood needed creative projects to take the house to the next level. During the spring semester of 1990, the Beta Omega pledge class created the Bar on the first floor as their pledge project. During the spring of 2004, Jason Wolf, Anthony Corcella, Galen Rice, Anthony Scotellaro, Mark SoHayda, Joe Knolmayer completed the deck in one night, thus allowing easier access to the green, the lawn area behind the deck.

The Dedication of the Chapter House was given to the Newark Fire Company of Ladder 4, Engine 2. The Chapter Room was dedicated to Tom Usewicz because of his involvement in the acquiring of the house. The Chapter Library was dedicated to Anthony Laporte, who passed away in a terrible motorcycle accident on the summer of 1996. Father John Dennehy was an advisor to our chapter and helped out a lot which in return, the chapter made him an honorary brother. We held a farewell for Father John at the Founder’s Day Formal in spring of 2002. Our 50th Anniversary of founding at NJIT was held on the fall semester of 2013.
